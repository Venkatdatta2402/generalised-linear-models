# Pharmacokinetics of Indomethacin — A Generalized Linear Modeling Approach

## Overview

This project explores the application of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to understand pharmacokinetic behavior using the Indomethacin dataset.

The analysis focuses on modeling the relationship between drug concentration and time following intravenous administration across multiple subjects. The dataset captures plasma concentration levels measured over time for six individuals after receiving indomethacin injections.

Rather than treating pharmacokinetic patterns as purely descriptive, this project frames them within a statistical modeling perspective to better understand variability, trends, and subject-level response behavior.

## Motivation

Pharmacokinetic data often exhibit non-linear patterns that traditional linear models may fail to capture effectively.

By using a GLM-based approach, this notebook investigates:

- How drug concentration evolves over time  
- How variability differs across subjects  
- How statistical modeling can help interpret biological processes  

This enables a shift from observation to structured modeling of drug behavior.

## What This Project Covers

- Application of Generalized Linear Models to pharmacokinetic data  
- Analysis of time-dependent drug concentration  
- Modeling subject-level variability  
- Understanding response patterns across individuals  

---

## Dataset Context

The Indometh dataset contains:

- Time points at which blood samples were collected  
- Plasma drug concentration levels  
- Multiple subjects receiving intravenous doses

This allows exploration of how drug distribution and clearance vary between individuals.

## Key Idea

Pharmacokinetic processes involve structured biological dynamics such as absorption, distribution, and elimination.

Using GLMs helps:

- Model concentration trends over time  
- Account for variability across subjects  
- Interpret drug behavior through a statistical lens  

This bridges classical pharmacology with modern statistical modeling.

## Outcome

Demonstrates how Generalized Linear Models can be used to extract meaningful patterns from pharmacokinetic data, enabling a more structured understanding of drug concentration dynamics across subjects.
